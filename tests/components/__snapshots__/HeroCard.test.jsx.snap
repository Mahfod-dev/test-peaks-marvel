          Rick Jones has been Hulk's best bud since day one, but now he's more than a friend...he's a teammate! Transformed by a Gamma energy explosion, A-Bomb's thick, armored skin is just as strong and powerful as it is blue. And when he curls into action, he uses it like a giant bowling ball of destruction!  A-Bomb (HAS)
